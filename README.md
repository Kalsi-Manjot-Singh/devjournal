# 📓 My Dev Journal

This is my coding diary. It’s not polished or fancy — just a record of what I build, break, and learn along the way.  

---

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This
- To track my progress and see how far I’ve come.  
- To remember the mistakes I made (so I don’t repeat them).  
- To hold myself accountable by making my journey public.  
- To share the *real* process of development, not just the highlights.

## 🛠️ How I Use This Repo
- Every project gets its own Markdown journal.  
- I try to write entries daily (sometimes weekly).  
- Commits are backdated to reflect when I actually wrote the code.  
- It’s more of a *timeline of my coding life* than a polished portfolio.

> 💭 Think of this repo as my notebook in public. Sometimes messy, sometimes exciting — but always real.
